			<h2>Agriculture</h2>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">Agriculture is the backbone of the Indian economy. Though it is the main source of livelihood for a majority of the Indian population, it still stands as a technologically backward sector. We are currently living in a world of technology which affects every aspect of our life. Technological advances coupled with new financial and environmental policies are the need of the hour. Boosting rural growth and agricultural productivity are the main goals here. Some of the major contributing factors for decline in healthy yield are given below:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Poor quality of soil</li>
				<li>Usage of non-permissible fertilizers</li>
				<li>Improper rainfall during cultivation of seasonal crops</li>
				<li>Non-identification of diseased plants at an early stage</li>
				<li>Inefficient training to farmers</li>
				<li>Mismatch of demand and supply</li>
				<li>Strategies used in transportation</li>
			</ul>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">Can your idea maximize returns and lower risks in agriculture, or perhaps find a better balance between production and consumption?</p>

			<!-- <h2>Problem Statements</h2>
			<ol style="font-weight: 600;">
				<li>Management of water distribution to agricultural land to minimize the loss and suggest potential linking of water sources</li>
				<li>Detection of adulterants in food</li>
				<li>Facilitation of purchase of fresh farm products from local vendors</li>
				<li>Identification of diseased crops at an early stage</li>
				<li>Decision support system to farmers that supports weather prediction using the historical weather data, germination of seeds, check on ground water level & fertility of soil, growth of potential crops in suitable geographical areas etc</li>
			</ol> -->
